The idea behind immunizing is to adjust the duration of assets and liabilities such that $D_{A}=D_{L}$. Under the assumption [inds√¶t antagelser], changes in interest rates will have no influence on the immunized portfolio, as the net duration is 0. Secondly, the company has to make sure, that it invests the exact amount such that it can pay the liabilities with the investment made today i. e. $PV_A = PV_B$

\begin{align*}
PV_{GIC1} = 100,000\cdot e^{-0.02\cdot 2} = \$ 95,31&3 \\
PV_{GIC2} = 110,000\cdot e^{-0.02\cdot 3} = \$ 102,35&8 \\
PV_{L} = 95,313 + 102,358 = \$ 197,67&2 \\
\end{align*}
